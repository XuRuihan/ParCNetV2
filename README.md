# [ParCNetV2: Oversized Kernel with Enhanced Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07157)

This repo is the official PyTorch implementation of **ParCNetV2** proposed by our paper "[ParCNetV2: Oversized Kernel with Enhanced Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07157)".

## Introduction

Transformers have shown great potential in various computer vision tasks. By borrowing design concepts from transformers, many studies revolutionized CNNs and showed remarkable results. This paper falls in this line of studies. Specifically, we propose a new convolutional neural network, **ParCNetV2**, that extends the research line of ParCNetV1 by bridging the gap between CNN and ViT. It introduces two key designs: 1) **O**versized **C**onvolution (**OC**) with twice the size of the input, and 2) **B**ifurcate **G**ate **U**nit (**BGU**) to ensure that the model is input adaptive. Fusing OC and BGU in a unified CNN, ParCNetV2 is capable of flexibly extracting global features like ViT, while maintaining lower latency and better accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over other convolutional neural networks and hybrid models that combine CNNs and transformers.

## Overview

Figure 2: **The transitions from the original ParC V1 to ParC V2 block.** Compared with ParCNetV1, we first introduce oversized convolutions to further enhance capacity while simplifying architecture; then we design a bifurcate gate unit to improve efficiency and strengthen attention; finally, we propose a uniform local-global block and construct the whole network with this uniform block.

## Train

We use batch size of 4096 by default and we show how to train models with 8 GPUs. For multi-node training, adjust `--grad-accum-steps` according to your situations.


```bash

DATA_PATH=/path/to/imagenet
CODE_PATH=/path/to/code/metaformer # modify code path here


ALL_BATCH_SIZE=4096
NUM_GPU=8
GRAD_ACCUM_STEPS=4 # Adjust according to your GPU numbers and memory size.
let BATCH_SIZE=ALL_BATCH_SIZE/NUM_GPU/GRAD_ACCUM_STEPS
MASTER_PORT=29501

cd $CODE_PATH && CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 python3 -m torch.distributed.launch \
--nproc_per_node=$NUM_GPU \
--master_port=$MASTER_PORT \
train.py $DATA_PATH \
--model parcnetv2_tiny --opt adamw --lr 4e-3 --warmup-epochs 20 \
-b $BATCH_SIZE --grad-accum-steps $GRAD_ACCUM_STEPS \
--drop-path 0.2 --head-dropout 0.0 \
> log/parcnetv2_tiny.log 2>&1
```
Training scripts of other models are shown in [scripts](/scripts/).
